#### Crash Landing on You Season 2 Release Date: When will it premiere?

Crash Landing on You season 1 premiered on December 15, 2019, on[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81159258). After airing two episodes every week, it wrapped up with its 16th episode in February, 2020.

As far as the next season goes, here’s what we know. There’s no denying that the show has amassed a massive fan following within short span of time. In fact, fans have even started an[online petition](https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/extend-crash-landing-on-you-because-it-has-united-the-world.html)demanding a renewal. Given the fandom and the fact that Netflix has been lately investing a lot in foreign shows, it won’t be wrong to presume that the show will get renewed. Our best estimate is that Crash Landing on You season 2 will most likely release sometime in **December 2020**.

### Fans are split on the idea

In most cases, fans are usually adamant that they want more episodes but in the case of Crash Landing on You, the fanbase seems split over whether the show should continue or conclude where it ends in season 1.

Several fans have taken to social media with one Twitter user commenting: "Just finished watching Crash Landing on You! Ep 15 & 16 made me cry! Congratulations team CLOY! Season 2 pls!"

Meanwhile, in the opposing camp, this fan added: "I don't get people who want season 2 for crash landing on you. like, what are you expecting to happen next???"

### Why there shouldn't be a second season

Crash Landing on You tells the story of a South Korean woman, Yoon Se-ri, who, in a freak paragliding accident, ends up crash landing in North Korea where she meets a sympathetic soldier, Ri Jeong-hyuk, who helps her to get home safely.

Over the course of their adventure together, the pair fall in love and the very end of the final episode sees the pair reunite in Switzerland, where Se-ri is staying on holiday, and they can finally enjoy each other's company without fear of retribution by either North or South Korea.

While their time together is only very brief, just two weeks a year, the ending wraps up the show really rather well.

Not only do the pair get the happy ending they deserve but all of the series' story threads are wrapped up neatly as well.

Bringing the show back for more would be an odd choice as you have to ask, where can the series really go from here, other than the pair coming to live together full time?

While there may be calls for more, it feels as if the ending of season 1 does all it needs to do for the series.

Whether or not we'll actually see more from Crash Landing on You remains to be seen.
