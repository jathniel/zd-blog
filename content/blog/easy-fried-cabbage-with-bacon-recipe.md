### INGREDIENTS

4 slices thick bacon

1 small yellow onion, diced

1 small head green cabbage, cored and chopped into 1-inch pieces

2 tsp. light brown sugar

salt

ground black pepper

Freshly chopped parsley leaves

### DIRECTIONS

1. In a large heavy-bottomed pan, cook bacon until crisp, about 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove bacon to a paper towelâ€“lined plate, leaving the drippings in the pan.
2. Add onion to the pan and increase heat to medium to high. Cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add cabbage and brown sugar. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is just tender for about 5 minutes.
3. Return bacon to the pan and toss to combine. Cook for 1 minute to heat through. Top with parsley and serve hot.
