## Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, rinsed and patted dry
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
* ½ cup soy sauce
* ½ cup apple cider vinegar
* ½ cup water
* 2 tablespoons pickling spice, wrapped in cheesecloth



## Directions

* Step 1

  Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until oil is shimmering. Cook garlic in oil for no more than 30 seconds. Add all of the chicken to the pot; cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is white all over. Do not brown.
* Step 2

  Pour in soy sauce, vinegar, and water, and add the pickling spice. Make sure the spice ball is submerged. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and place lid on pot so that some steam can escape. Simmer for 1 hour, or until chicken is very tender.
